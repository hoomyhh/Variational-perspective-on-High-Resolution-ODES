# Variational-perspective-on-High-Resolution-ODES

In this project we provide a variational perspective on high/resolution ODEs. This will uncover the special choices of ODEs to recover accelerated algorithms and creates a framework
to build Lyapunov functions. Our analysis lead to several improved convergence rates and algorithms.
